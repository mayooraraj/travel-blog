        <h5 style="padding: 0px 250px;line-height:40px;font-weight: lighter;">Hi! We're Mayoora & Dharshan, two creatives from The Netherlands that run a 'travel content creation' company named Salt in our Hair. From our passion for traveling, photography, and sharing experiences, Salt in our Hair was born on Instagram. As of May 2016, we set ourselves the goal to capture the world in a way so that people see more than only their nine to five job.</h5>

                Hmmm... Let's see. I would probably describe myself as a girl who can't function when   her stomach is growling.That's why I'm always keeping one eye on the streets to find the perfect bakery (with carrot cake). Next, I can't resist puppy cuteness, especially at the beach with sunset.</p>

                That guy with the big amount of curls, that's me: Hi, I'm Dharshan! I would describe myself as a photo perfectionist. Keep on trying until it's done! Yeah, that can take some time, but hey, taking photos is a thing we love both, so it's not a punishment to do. Since traveling, I found myself to be interested in learning other languages.</p>
